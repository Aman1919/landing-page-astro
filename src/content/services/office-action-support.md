We prepare our comments for all types of objections in office actions/ First Examination Report issued from Indian Patent office. The comments are prepared based on understanding of subject matter of patent specification and claims. Comments are provided to prove novelty and inventive step of the invention disclosed in patent application. The prior art cited by the examiner are differentiated based on the context of the invention.

Clients seeking patent protection can benefit significantly from support in responding to Office Actions, as it increases the likelihood of overcoming objections and securing a granted patent. Our approach aligns with the needs of inventors and businesses navigating the patent examination process in India.
