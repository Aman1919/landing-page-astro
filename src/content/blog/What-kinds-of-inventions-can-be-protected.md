title: "What kinds of inventions can be protected?"
description: "Patents may be granted for inventions in any field of technology, from an everyday kitchen utensil to a nanotechnology chip. An invention can be a product – such as a chemical compound, or a process, for example – a process for producing a specific chemical compound. Many products, in fact, contain a number of inventions. For example, a laptop computer can involve hundreds of inventions, working together."

If you’ve come up with an innovative idea, you may be wondering how to protect it from being copied or used without your permission. One of the most effective ways to safeguard your invention is by obtaining a patent. But what kinds of inventions qualify for patent protection?

### What Can Be Patented?

Patents can be granted for inventions across nearly any field of technology. Whether it’s a product or a process, if your invention is new, useful, and non-obvious, it may be eligible for a patent. Here's a closer look at what can be protected:

1. **Products:** A patent can protect physical products, from something as simple as a kitchen gadget to something as complex as a pharmaceutical compound. For example, a new design for a tool, a chemical composition, or a medical device could all be eligible for patent protection.

2. **Processes:** In addition to products, patents can also cover processes or methods. This might include a new way of manufacturing a product or a novel process for producing a chemical compound. If your process adds value by being more efficient or cost-effective, it could be patent-worthy.

### Complex Inventions and Multiple Patents

Many modern products consist of several different inventions working together, and each of those components can be patented individually. Take a laptop computer, for example. A laptop could contain hundreds of separate patented inventions, from the design of its hardware components to the software that runs it. Each patent protects a specific aspect of the overall product.

### Why Patent Protection Matters

Obtaining a patent gives you exclusive rights to your invention, allowing you to prevent others from making, using, or selling it without your permission. This legal protection can help you maintain a competitive advantage and ensure that your innovation remains under your control.

In summary, whether your invention is a product or a process, if it’s new and innovative, it may qualify for patent protection. From everyday items to advanced technologies, patents play a crucial role in protecting intellectual property and driving innovation.
