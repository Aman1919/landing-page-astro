title: "Why protect inventions with patents?"
description: "The patent owner has the exclusive right to prevent or stop others from commercially exploiting the patented invention for a limited period within the country or region in which the patent was granted. In other words, patent protection means that the invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed, imported or sold by others without the patent owner's consent. If such acts are carried out by third parties without such consent, the patent owner can go to court to seek remedies for patent infringement."

Innovation is the driving force behind many businesses and industries. However, turning ideas into valuable products or processes requires more than creativity — it also requires protecting those inventions from unauthorized use. This is where patents come in. A patent offers inventors exclusive rights, enabling them to safeguard their creations and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

### Exclusive Rights and Control

A patent grants the owner exclusive rights over their invention for a limited time, typically 20 years from the filing date. During this period, the patent owner has the legal authority to prevent others from making, using, distributing, importing, or selling the patented invention within the country or region where the patent was granted.

This exclusive control is crucial for protecting the commercial value of an invention. Without a patent, competitors could replicate and sell the invention, undermining the original inventor’s ability to profit from their innovation. Patents act as a shield, giving inventors the chance to reap the financial rewards of their hard work.

### Preventing Unauthorized Use

One of the primary benefits of patent protection is the ability to stop others from commercially exploiting the patented invention without consent. This means that, once a patent is granted, no one else can produce, sell, or distribute the invention in the protected region without the patent owner’s permission. If a third party violates this protection, the patent owner has the right to take legal action for patent infringement.

Such legal remedies may include injunctions to stop the infringing activity and damages to compensate for any financial loss incurred by the patent owner. This ability to enforce patent rights through the legal system gives inventors the power to defend their innovations and prevent others from unfairly capitalizing on them.

### Strengthening Market Position

Patents also provide a strategic advantage by helping inventors and businesses strengthen their market position. By securing exclusive rights to an invention, patent holders can eliminate or significantly reduce competition in a particular field. This not only boosts profits but also enhances the brand's credibility and market dominance.

For companies that rely on innovation, patents are valuable assets. They can be leveraged in several ways:

1. **Licensing:** Patent holders can grant licenses to others, allowing them to use the invention in exchange for royalties or licensing fees. This creates additional revenue streams.

2. **Selling the patent:** In some cases, patent holders may choose to sell their patents, allowing them to capitalize on their inventions without investing in manufacturing or distribution.
Encouraging Innovation

3. **Patents don't just protect individual inventors or businesses:** they also contribute to the broader innovation ecosystem. By offering inventors exclusive rights, patents create a powerful incentive for further research and development. Inventors know that their work will be protected, and they can benefit from their creativity, encouraging continuous technological advancements and new solutions to real-world problems.

### Conclusion

In summary, protecting inventions with patents is essential for safeguarding the commercial value of innovation. A patent grants exclusive rights to the patent holder, allowing them to control the use and sale of their invention while preventing unauthorized use. It also provides legal recourse in the event of patent infringement. Beyond individual protection, patents foster a culture of innovation, encouraging inventors to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
